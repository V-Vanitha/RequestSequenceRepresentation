# RequestSequenceRepresentation

### Location
This application belongs to the representation layer.

### Description
The RequestSequenceRepresentation application converts the tabular information as it is provided by EATL://v1/list-records-of-flow into a graphical representation.  
This is for supporting the administrators of the application layer in its debugging.  

Registering and a reduced embedding process makes the connection to EaTL available for approval in ALT and operation key management by OKM.  
Basic management and self-information services are supported.  
User management is carried out via the AdministratorAdministration application.  
The RequestSequenceRepresentation can also be started via the GenericRepresentation application.  
An update process (bequeath-your-data-and-die) is not supported.  
There is no application data to be stored in a file or database.  

### Relevance
This application supports efficiently debugging the application layer.
